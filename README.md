//Football Jump is a 2D platformer game where you play as a football player who jumps over watermelons to reach a yellow flag. If you fall off the platform or hit a watermelon, you lose and either respawn or restart the level. I created the game using Unity and made several script changes to improve it. One important change I made was adding a ground check so the player can only jump when on the ground, which stops double-jumping. I also made it so the player respawns if they hit an obstacle and the level restarts if they fall below a certain point. I’m most proud of making the full game work with all the win and lose conditions, especially the funny idea of a football player jumping over watermelons. One challenge I faced was getting the jumping to work properly, but I solved it by learning how to use ground detection with colliders. Overall, I learned a lot about scripting, level design, and problem-solving, and I had fun creating a game that’s simple, silly, and fun to play.
